# Code for digrastudents.org

This is the source code for the website of the DiGRA student representatives [digrastudents.org](http://digrastudents.org/).

The site is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/), and [H5BP](http://html5boilerplate.com/). Icons courtesy of [FontAwesome](http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome/) by Dave Gandy.

The site uses a lot of Jekyll plugins and filters, which were cobbled together from [Octopress](http://octopress.org/), [BlackBulletIV](https://github.com/BlackBulletIV/blackbulletiv.github.com/), and others.

The site is also using a few [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) plugins, [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/), and [Fayer](http://sandeepjain.github.com/fayer/).

The forums are powered by [Discourse](http://www.discourse.org/). The source code is not included here, but it is [available](http://github.com/discourse/discourse).
