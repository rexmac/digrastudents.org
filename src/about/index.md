This is the website for the student members of DiGRA, which is the largest non-profit international association of professionals, academics, developers, and other individuals interested in the evolving field of digital gaming and game related studies.

The current student representatives of DiGRA, [Rachel Kowert](#rkowert) and [Ashley O'Toole-Brown](#abrown) developed this website with the idea of fostering an international community of students and early career researchers studying digital games. It is hoped that this community can be a valuable resource for developments in the field, professional  networking, and disseminating research (as well as finding conference buddies)!

You do not need to be an official member of DiGRA to participate, but membership is encouraged. DiGRA membership offers many benefits and helps your representatives  serve you better. To join, or for more information, visit the [DiGRA homepage](http://www.digra.org/join).

### Rachel Kowert

<img class="align-left" src="/img/rkowert.jpg" alt="Photo of Rachel Kowert" />Rachel graduated from the [University of Texas at Dallas](http://www.utdallas.edu/) in May 2005 with a B.A. in Psychology. As she always had an interest in psychotherapy, she began looking into various clinical graduate programs shortly after graduation. Rachel began her M.A. in Counseling Psychology at [Santa Clara University](http://www.scu.edu/cp/) in 2006. This graduate program was exceptionally rewarding, both professionally and personally, as it gave her a first look into the more personal side of psychology. While she immensely enjoyed her time at SCU, it became clear early on that she was more interested in the research side of psychology than the clinical side. Her supervisor at the time had casually mentioned a recent influx of concern surrounding video game use, particularly online video game play. However, at that time, there was little to no research on this topic, leaving clinicans with little information to disseminate to their clients. This planted the first seed for her PhD thesis topic, and she soon began searching for a suitable research-based PhD program.

She secured a PhD researcher position at the [University of York](http://www.york.ac.uk/psychology/) in York, England where she began her studies in 2009. Under the supervision of Dr. Julian Oldmeadow, Rachel's work aligned across two branches of inquiry: the cultural stereotype of online gamers and relationship between social (in)competence and online video game involvement. While the first highlighted the centrality of the negative social perceptions of online game players, the second examined the validity of this perception through an assessment of the relationship between video game involvement and social competence.

Rachel is currently working with [Prof. Dr. Thorsten Quandt](http://www.uni-muenster.de/Kowi/en/personen/thorsten-quandt.html) at the [University of Münster](https://www.uni-muenster.de/en/) in Germany as one of the team members working on the large-scale, [ERC](http://erc.europa.eu/)-project “SOFOGA” (Social Foundations of Online Gaming). Her work in this project primarily focuses on examining the potential social impact of online video game involvement over time.
