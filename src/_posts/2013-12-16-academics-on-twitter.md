What began as a crowd sourcing experiment on Twitter by [Jamie Madigan](http://www.psychologyofgames.com/) ([@JamieMadigan](http://www.twitter.com/JamieMadigan)), has now become an excellent resource of video game academic types on Twitter. DiGRAstudents.org is happy to be hosting a copy of what has grown to be a compilation of information for over 50 game studies researchers across the globe.  [Check it out](http://digrastudents.org/games-research-twitter/)!

Cheers,
