DiGRA 2013 will be hosted by Georgia Tech University in Atlanta, Georgia (USA) from August 26 - 29.

More information about the conference can be found on [the official page](http://dm.lmc.gatech.edu/digra2013/). <!--more-->

DiGRA 2013 is also need of student volunteers! As a volunteer, you’ll be expected to work 16 hours over the course of the conference and your registration fee will be waived (Any other costs, including travel and hotel, are still the volunteer’s responsibility). To sign up as a volunteer, please fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1fkXPEc7-cGFaZtAq4ybIdJJkcLxY_neF9Wz_jJNNMxw/viewform) before July 1. They are accepting volunteers on a first-come, first-served basis.

If you are attending DiGRA 2013, be sure and stop by the panel hosted by your student representatives! Ashley O'Toole-Brown and Rachel Kowert will be hosting a panel entitled “Defragging the Methodology of Games Studies”.  This panel will bring together top scholars within the field in an open forum to “defrag” this aspect of our work that is often overlooked, and discuss challenges, constraints, and proposed future directions in the methodology of studying games and players. Panelists will include [Nick Bowman](http://comm.wvu.edu/fs/faculty/nick_bowman) (West Virginia University), [Jussi Holopainen](http://scholar.google.de/citations?user=LMEjiCYAAAAJ&hl=en) (Games and Experimental Entertainment Lab Europe), [Celia Pearce](http://www.digitallounge.gatech.edu/faculty/?id=17) (Georgia Institute of Technology), and [Natasha Whiteman](http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/media/people/natasha-whiteman) (University of Leicester). 

The panel will discuss a range of methodological problems, or issues, before opening the discussion up for audience participation. The audience will be encouraged to comment on the panelists’ methodological issues, with a view to spark further discussion in the rest of the session. This format, structure, and topic should be interesting for not only students and early career researchers, but also for researchers who have spent much time in the field and have encountered problems, frustrations, and even success with particular methodologies. 

We hope to see you there!
