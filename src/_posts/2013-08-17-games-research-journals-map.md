DiGRA Students is happy to announce the launch of the [Games Research Journals Map](http://digrastudents.org/games-research-journals/)!

There has been a recent thread across the GAMESNETWORK mailing list about what academic journals are pertinent for game scholars (i.e., what journals actively publish games-related articles). I myself had often wondered this and started to compile a list of the different journals I knew of that regularly published games-related articles a few months ago. This week (with the help of our webmaster extraordinaire) DiGRA Students has combined my pre-existing list with the suggestions from the GAMESNETWORK thread, and DiGRA Student contributors, to create the [Games Research Journals Map](http://digrastudents.org/games-research-journals/)!

As our updated version of the [Games Research Positions Map](http://digrastudents.org/games-research-positions/) has received so much positive feedback, the new "Journal Research Map" has been structured in a similar way. It is completely searchable, sortable (by name, discipline, publisher, or frequency of publications), and contains a range of important information about the different academic journals in the field that regularly publish games-centric research (e.g., impact factor, word limits, link to submission guidelines, etc.). Check it out here: [http://digrastudents.org/games-research-journals/](http://digrastudents.org/games-research-journals/).

We hope that the Games Research Journals Map will soon become a valuable resource for students and academics alike! Please feel free to pass this information along to any other mailing lists/researchers who may be interested in such a resource.

Also, if there is a journal that has been overlooked, or see an error in one of the postings, please let us know via [this thread](http://discourse.digrastudents.org/t/journal-research-map/) on the DiGRA Student forums. As the only known list of its kind, we would like to keep it as accurate and comprehensive as possible.

Cheers,

Your DiGRA Student Reps (Rachel & Ashley)
