After months of hard work with the Atlanta-based Georgia Tech crew, we are very excited to announce special, student-focused features for DiGRA 2013!

## Mentors!

DiGRA 2013 will have a mentorship programme unlike any other. And we’ve got badges. We’ve all been there. Too nervous to approach a favourite author. Too afraid of rejection to ask the big shot in the room about postdoc opportunities. Too worried about being a nuisance to start a conversation with a favourite developer. Well, Student DiGRA has the answer- social lubricant in the form of badges! Keep an eye out during breaks and meals for folks walking around with a mentor badge. These are professionals, researchers, and lecturers who have identified themselves as eager for student contact. They are happy for students to ask questions about almost anything related to games studies during meals or breaks. So now you can approach with confidence!

## Drinks! 

As some of you might have noticed in [the programme](http://dm.lmc.gatech.edu/digra2013/program/), on Monday, 26 August, from 16:00-18:00, Student DiGRA is hosting a student-only welcoming reception. What you probably did not know is that this reception will take place upstairs at [Publik](http://www.publikatl.com/), a pub just 75ft south of the [Georgian Terrace Hotel](http://www.thegeorgianterrace.com/) (aka the conference venue). We also have 20 drink tickets to give away to the first 20 students who check in and register at the conference reception. Registration starts at 15:30, so be sure to get there early, sign in, grab a student flyer and meet Rachel and I down at the pub! The first keynote starts at 18:00, which leaves just enough time for a cheeky pint. Don’t forget to follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/{{ site.author.twitter }}) and [Facebook](http://facebook.com/{{ site.author.facebook }}) for even more exciting news and updates.

We look forward to seeing you all in Atlanta!

Your Student Reps - Rachel & Ashley
