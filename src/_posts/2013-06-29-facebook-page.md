Hi all! We have created a new [Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/{{ site.author.facebook }}")! It will function the same way as our current Facebook Group, but with a lot more back-end features to help me and Ashley better manage and keep track of our little community :) We would like to get everyone moved over to the page, and then close/remove the group. Of course, we will allow plenty of time for everyone to migrate over before closing the group. This is also a good opportunity to re-advertise this space to anyone you may know who studies, or is interesting in studying, anything DiGRA related!
