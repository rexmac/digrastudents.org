The [original content of this table](http://www.digarec.org/gamesresearchmap/doku.php?id=start:gamesresearchmap) comes from the [Digital Games Research Center](http://www.digarec.org/). We found the original table to be rather unwieldly, so to improve accessibility (and usability), we re-deployed the information here. If you would like to submit a new position or any corrections to existing info in the table, please [use this thread](http://discourse.digrastudents.org/t/help-keep-our-games-research-map-updated) on our forums. <span class="games-research-timestamp"></span>

<div class="alert alert-info">

<p class="hint">Hold <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> to sort by more than one column or to un-sort a column.</p>
